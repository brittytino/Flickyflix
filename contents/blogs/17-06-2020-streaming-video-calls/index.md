Ever wondered how cool it'd be to host an Instagram Live session with multiple users? Well it's even more fun when you can leverage OBS studio to add cool effects and screens to your live streams on Instagram. In this tutorial we'll learn how to Go Live on instagram from your online meeting sessions on Zoom or Google Meet using OBS Studio and Streamon directly from your PC.
> Throughout the blog we'll be using examples using [Whereby](https://whereby.com), which is an online video call/meeting platform just like [Google meet](https://meet.google.com) or [Zoom](https://zoom.us). The steps will be similar if you are using any of the online meeting softwares.


Before we start make sure you have signed up or installed all the required softwares in your system.
- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.org)
- [Streamon](https://getstreamon.com)
- Account on any of the video calling softwares [Zoom](https://zoom.us), [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com), Or [Whereby](https://whereby.com) (recommended)

## 1. Starting your video call or meeting online
First step is to create an account on any of the online video calling or meeting softwares like [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com), [Zoom](https://zoom.us) or [Whereby](https://whereby.com) and start the video calling session with your desired participants. Once you started the call make sure all your participants are visible on your screen (_not necessary to have you on the screen, since we can use your webcam's feed directly into OBS studio_);

The above example is using Whereby, you can use Zoom, Google Hangouts, Skype or any of your favorite app and invite any number of users.

## 1. Setting up OBS Studio

Head over to OBS Studio's [home page](https://obsproject.com/) to download and install the Software on your system. Once the installation is complete open OBS Studio.

### Configuring a new stream profile and video output

Most of your viewers will be on a mobile device and mobile device screens are of a different aspect ration than your computer. Click on **Profile** menu on OBS at the top and click on **New Profile** and name the Profile as `Instagram Streaming`.

Now, Click on **settings** in the bottom right panel and go to the **Video tab**. Change the **Base (canvas) Resolution** to any of the **9:16** aspect ratio, in my case it's `900x1600` of my monitor. And, set the **Output (scaled) resolution** to `720x1280`. Click on **Apply** and **OK**.

### Including the video calls form browser to OBS Studio
Once you are done setting up OBS Studio, we can start working on bringing the video call from the browser to OBS Studio. Click on the "+" icon in the bottom "Sources" tab and choose **Window Capture** and choose your browser window which is used for the video call or the application (zoom) through which you are having the video call.

You can use the handles to transform the preview and fit it to the screen, or hold alt ant drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you crop the preview for one user, you can repeat the above to step to add the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to get each other users as well.

If you want to add yourself into the Stream from your PC attached web cam or other camera devices connected, use the **Video Source** Option instead of **Window Capture** and choose your target device while adding the source.

Make sure you have unmuted the **Desktop Audio** and **Mic/Aux** or any mic connected to your PC from the Audio Mixed tab at the bottom center of OBS.

You can save your current configuration and resuse it for future usecases.
