## 1. Streaming your android device to your PC

Install and Open the [Screen Stream Over HTTP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.dvkr.screenstream&hl=en) app on your android phone and click on the **play** button on the bottom to start streaming your screen over HTTP. Make sure both your laptop/desktop and phone is on the same wifi network. Note down the URL shown in the app and open it in the browser.

### Configuring a new stream profile and video output

Most of your viewers will be on a mobile device and mobile device screens are of a different aspect ration than your computer. Click on **Profile** menu on OBS at the top and click on **New Profile** and name the Profile as `Instagram Streaming`.

Now, Click on **settings** in the bottom right panel and go to the **Video tab**. Change the **Base (canvas) Resolution** to any of the **9:16** aspect ratio, in my case it's `900x1600` of my monitor. And, set the **Output (scaled) resolution** to `720x1280`. Click on **Apply** and **OK**.

### Adding your phone screen as video source

Once we configured the video output, we need to add a video source. Click on the **+** icon from the bottom left, second panel which says **Sources** and click on `Window Capture` and choose the **Screen Stream** browser window on **Window** selcetion which is streaming your mobile screen. Once, the device is being added you can simply use the handles on the preview to adjust the view to the canvas. If you want to rotate the view, right click on the preview, select transform and choose **Rotate 90 degrees**.
