But, Instagram only support streaming through their offical app. Introducing [Streamon](https://getstreamon.com)!

### Configuring a new stream profile and video output
Most of your viewers will be on a mobile device and mobile device screens are of a different aspect ration than your computer. Click on **Profile** menu on OBS at the top and click on **New Profile** and name the Profile as `Instagram Streaming`.

Now, Click on **settings** in the bottom right panel and go to the **Video tab**. Change the **Base (canvas) Resolution** to any of the **9:16** aspect ratio, in my case it's `900x1600` of my monitor. And, set the **Output (scaled) resolution** to `720x1280`. Click on **Apply** and **OK**.

### Adding a video source
Once we configured the video output, we need to add a video source. Connect your camera, or you can simply use your PC's screencast to be used as a video source. Click on the **+** icon from the bottom left, second panel which says **Sources** and click on any Video source that you want. In here, I'll be using my PC's screen capture, you can choose your Camera's listed there. A popup will open, click on okay and you can start configuring the view.

Once you have added the view, you can click on the preview and use the handles to drag the added source to fit to the canvas.
